## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-03

### Summary
This release is primarily a documentation and metadata refresh to prepare the project for the 1.0.0 milestone. It standardizes platform guidance for Windows and Linux, clarifies save/chooser fallbacks, and updates version metadata used by the runtime and package manifest.

### Changed
- Project metadata
  - `Project.toml` version updated from `0.9.0` â†’ `1.0.0`.
  - Runtime constant `APP_VERSION` updated to `1.0.0` in `src/graph_digitizer.jl`.
  - README and example README now reference the packaged version `1.0.0`.
- Documentation updates (user-facing and developer docs)
  - `README.md`
    - Explicitly states the project/docs are aimed at Windows and Linux.
    - Reworded installation notes to call out Linux system GTK packages and Windows prebuilt binaries (removed macOS-specific guidance).
    - Standardised shortcut phrasing to reference `Ctrl`/`Primary` for Windows and Linux.
    - Clarified fallback save behavior (Downloads folder or system temp) and that the status label is updated with the fallback path.
  - `examples/assets/sample_README.md`
    - Brought into alignment with main README (Windows/Linux emphasis).
  - `docs/API_REFERENCE.md`, `docs/utilities.md`, `docs/types.md`, `docs/functions_data_transforms.md`
    - Updated platform notes and wording to explicitly emphasize Windows and Linux behavior where platform-specific caveats appear (file chooser fallbacks, GTK runtime availability, Downloads-folder fallback, accelerator behavior).
    - Clarified safe dialog behavior when native file choosers are unavailable (prefer Downloads on Windows/Linux; system temp as fallback).
- Source comments and inline help
  - `src/graph_digitizer.jl`
    - Updated inline README generator (`ensure_readme`) content to reference `Primary+S` as `Ctrl+S` on Windows/Linux where appropriate.
    - Modified some help text strings to reflect Windows/Linux guidance.
    - Minor code comments updated to match the docs changes.
- New project file
  - `CHANGELOG.md` (this file) added to record the version bump and documentation changes.

### Fixed / Improved
- Documentation consistency:
  - Removed mixed references to macOS-specific shortcuts and clarified the platform behavior to prioritize Windows and Linux.
  - Ensured "safe save" and "safe open" dialog descriptions are explicit about Downloads vs temp fallback behavior on Windows/Linux.
  - Strengthened wording around GTK runtime requirements for Linux distributions (advice to install distribution packages) and Windows (prebuilt binaries with Gtk.jl).
- Developer docs:
  - API reference and function-level docs now state that examples and platform notes are oriented toward Windows and Linux.

### Notes for users & developers
- If you use the Julia environment pinned here:
  - Run the following from the repository root to instantiate the environment:
    - `julia --project=@. -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()'`
  - Launch the application from the project root:
    - `julia --project=@. src/graph_digitizer.jl`
  - Keep the launching terminal open for diagnostic messages; the application prints status messages, fallback save paths, and startup diagnostics to stdout/stderr.
- GTK on Linux:
  - Gtk.jl often requires system GTK libraries. On Debian/Ubuntu-based distros install packages like `libgtk-3-dev` or the distro-equivalent GTK runtime packages before using Gtk.jl.
- GTK on Windows:
  - Gtk.jl typically uses prebuilt GTK binaries; follow Gtk.jl's installation guidance for Windows if you encounter issues.
- Shortcuts:
  - Primary key binding is `Ctrl` on Windows and Linux in the UI and documentation. If you are using a platform that maps Primary to another modifier, consult your environment.
- Save fallback behavior:
  - When a native file chooser dialog cannot be constructed (various Gtk.jl / environment combinations), the application will attempt to write to your `Downloads` folder on Windows and Linux. If that is not available, it will fall back to the system temporary directory. The full path used is shown in the app's status label.

If you want, I can:
- Add more granular changelog history prior to v1.0.0 (import previous release notes or derive entries from git history).
- Produce a release checklist (packaging, tagging, CI tasks) for making an official 1.0.0 release (git tag and optional GitHub release notes).
- Generate a small "Windows/Linux setup" HOWTO snippet (copyable commands) for common distributions (Ubuntu/Debian/Fedora) and Windows (MSYS2/Chocolatey), to include in docs or README.
